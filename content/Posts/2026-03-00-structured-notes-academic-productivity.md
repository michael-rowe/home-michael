description: Most academics accumulate meeting notes, project files, and output records without realising these documents could function as a queryable database. When structured with consistent metadata, they become something AI can reason across — producing perspectives on your own scholarly life that no single document, annual review, or institutional system can provide. This post argues for treating operational documentation as infrastructure, not housekeeping.

> [!info] Structure is what separates a record from a resource
> Operational notes — meetings, projects, outputs, relationships — are already being written. The question is whether they are structured in a way that allows anything to reason across them. Without structure, you have an archive. With it, you have a database — and a database combined with AI surfaces patterns in your scholarly life that no single document, no annual review, and no amount of personal recall can show you.

Academics document more than they realise. Meeting notes pile up across folders and email threads. Project files are started at the beginning of a semester and left open indefinitely. Output records — publications, presentations, supervision milestones — are scattered across CV drafts and annual review submissions.

All of this is documentation. None of it, typically, is a database.

The difference is structure. A pile of notes, however comprehensive, is an archive — searchable by keyword, navigable by memory, but not queryable by relationship or type. A database is navigable differently: retrieve all active projects in this domain; surface every meeting where a decision was recorded; identify the outputs from the last twelve months and what they represent. The same information, structured consistently, unlocks a fundamentally different kind of academic productivity.

## What structured notes make possible

This is not about note-taking aesthetics. It is about adding consistent metadata to the documents you are already creating — a small block of structured fields at the top of each file that declares what the document is, what it connects to, and where it sits in the larger system.

A meeting note with a `participants` field, a `project` link, and a `decisions` section is the same meeting note. It takes the same amount of time to write. But it is now part of a relational system — connected to the project it advanced, linked to the people in the room, distinguishable from meetings where nothing was decided.

```yaml
participants: [Dr Smith, PG student Jones]
project: "[[AI Literacy Module]]"
domain: Teaching
decisions: Agreed to extend submission deadline to 14 April
follow_up_date: 2026-04-14
needs_review: true
```

That connection is invisible to you when you write it. It becomes visible when something reads across the whole collection.

That something is AI.

A language model reading across a well-structured note system can answer questions no single document could — and that would take hours to reconstruct manually. What proportion of your meetings have produced a recorded decision? Which projects have had no activity in the last month? What domains have most of your time and energy gone into this year? Who are the people you've worked with most intensively, and on what?

These are not questions about your knowledge or your ideas. They are questions about your working life — the actual shape of how you spend your time and where your effort goes. Most academics have no reliable way to answer them. The institutional systems that track academic work — HR records, research management platforms, annual review forms — see only what is formally reported. They miss the texture of the work: the meeting that actually moved a project forward, the supervision session that mattered, the relationship that is quietly becoming a collaboration.

## What the record shows that memory won't

When I ask an AI to read across a month of operational notes and tell me what happened, the answer is consistently more useful than my own recollection — not because the AI knows more than I do, but because it reads without the cognitive biases I bring to self-assessment. I tend to remember the dramatic moments and the visible outputs. A structured system records the quiet decisions, the steady maintenance of relationships, the projects that are drifting without a clear next step. The gap between what I think I've been doing and what the record shows is often instructive.

This is the diagnostic value of structured operational notes. Not surveillance, not performance management — but a way of seeing your own working life with the kind of clarity that normally only comes in retrospect, usually too late to act on it. The question "is this the kind of scholar I intended to be this year?" is much harder to answer from memory than from a well-maintained record.

The same infrastructure that enables this diagnostic view also enables more practical things. A weekly review that used to take an hour of effortful reconstruction can be generated in minutes from the underlying notes — freeing that hour for the thinking the review is supposed to prompt.

A record of scholarly outputs, with full context for each, is always current rather than reconstructed at the point of need. A briefing document for a new project can be assembled from existing meeting notes and project files rather than written from scratch.

## What this requires

The honest answer is that building the system requires a period of setup that most academics resist. Consistent structure across documents — a shared metadata vocabulary, a disciplined set of note types, the habit of adding a decisions section to meeting notes — takes time to establish and feels unrewarding until the system reaches a critical mass.

The payoff is asymmetric and delayed. A month of structured notes produces modest returns. A year produces a genuinely useful diagnostic record. Several years produce something closer to a continuous autobiography of your scholarly practice — queryable, AI-readable, immune to the selective memory that distorts most career self-assessments.

The value is not in any single note. A meeting note that records a decision is unremarkable. A year of meeting notes where AI can identify which meetings produced decisions, which projects those decisions advanced, and how the pattern of decisions maps onto your stated priorities — that is something different. The database is the unit of value, not the record.

The minimum viable starting point is a markdown editor and two templates — one for meetings, one for daily notes — both of which take about thirty minutes to set up.

A meeting note template captures the relational fields that make it queryable: who was there, what project it connected to, what was decided, and whether it needs follow-up.

```yaml

title: Team meeting — AI Literacy Module
participants: [Dr Smith, PG student Jones]
project: "[[AI Literacy Module]]"
domain: Teaching
decisions: Agreed to extend submission deadline to 14 April
follow_up_date: 2026-04-14
needs_review: true
---

## Agenda
-

## Decisions
-

## Actions
- [ ]

## Notes
-
```

A daily note template links each day to its surrounding week and records what actually happened — closing the gap between what you intended and what you did.

```yaml
---
date: 2026-03-21
week_note: "[[2026-W12]]"
---

## Focus
-

## Activity today
-

## Notes
###
```

These two templates, used consistently, are enough to begin. The meeting note captures decisions and connects to projects; the daily note tracks what actually happened and situates it in time. Together they form the backbone of an [[2026-02-24-ai-ready-knowledge-base|AI-ready knowledge base]] — not a sophisticated system, but a consistent one.

What it does *not* require is converting your intellectual life into YAML. The knowledge you are developing, the ideas you are working on, the arguments you are building — those can remain as loosely structured as suits your thinking. The distinction is between *generative* documentation (thinking, writing, exploring) and *operational* documentation (meetings, projects, outputs, relationships). The operational layer is where consistent structure pays the highest return, because it is already structured in principle — it just needs to be consistent in practice.

## Why this is a design problem, not a technology one

Documentation changes character when AI becomes its reader — from reference material that tolerates imprecision to [[documentation-as-infrastructure|operational architecture]] that demands it.

Your operational working notes are not just documents to be read. They are the primary evidence of what kind of academic you are, how you allocate your time and energy, and whether your daily activity is connected to your longer-term intentions. Structured correctly, they become a system you can interrogate and AI can read across — not once, at annual review, but continuously, as a natural part of how you reflect on your work.

Most academics are already doing the documentation. The question is whether it is structured in a way that makes it useful beyond the moment of writing. That is a design choice, not a technology problem, and it is available to anyone willing to spend a few months building the habit.

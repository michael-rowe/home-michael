title: Distributed version control
description: Distributed version control is an approach to tracking file changes where every contributor holds a complete copy of the repository and its full history, rather than depending on a central server. It enables offline work, parallel development, and resilience against data loss.

> [!info] Every contributor holds the full history, not just the current files.

## Distributed version control

**One-sentence definition:** Distributed version control is a system for tracking changes to files in which every contributor's copy contains the complete history of the project, rather than connecting to a central store of that history.

The alternative is *centralised* version control, where a single server holds the history and contributors check files in and out. If that server fails, work stops. In a distributed system, every clone is a full backup — contributors can work independently and synchronise later.

**Why distribution matters:**

- **Resilience**: no single point of failure. Any copy can restore the project.
- **Offline work**: the full history is local, so you can commit, branch, and browse history without a network connection.
- **Parallel development**: contributors work independently in their own copies and merge when ready, rather than serialising access to shared files.
- **Transparency**: the complete history travels with the project. Anyone with a copy can see how it evolved.

### Distinction from file syncing

Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive) syncs current file states but does not record a meaningful history of changes. You can recover a recent version, but you cannot see what changed between versions, who changed it, or why. Version control tracks *intentional* checkpoints with descriptions, not automatic saves.

### Relevance to open scholarship

Distributed version control makes the development of a scholarly project legible. Essays, datasets, and teaching materials can have auditable histories — showing how arguments evolved, where sources were added, and how collaborators contributed. Platforms like GitHub surface this history publicly, supporting the open scholarship principle that process, not just output, carries scholarly value. [[Notes/git|Git]] is the dominant implementation.

## Notes

Git is by far the most widely used distributed version control system. Mercurial was a notable alternative but has largely ceded ground to git.
